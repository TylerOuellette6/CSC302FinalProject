# CSC302FinalProject

This web app is to be used to view and edit data about a network of nodes and edges, and to
calculate popular network stats. In order to use the app, the user is required to upload an
edge file made up of all connections between nodes in the network. The user is also given the 
option to upload a nodes file, made up just the nodes within the network. Uploaded documents
must be .tsv or .csv formatted. The user will then have some options of how to manipulate the data.
Once the data is uploaded, the app will display tables containing data about the network such as
centrality measures and degree measures. The user will also have the option to export their calculated
data.
